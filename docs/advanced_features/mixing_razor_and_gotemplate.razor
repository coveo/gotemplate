## Operators mixin

Note that you cannot combine razor extended expression (+, -,  /, *, etc.) with go template expression such as in:

###### Razor syntax
```
# In this statement, | is interpreted as bitwise or between 2 and 4
{{ add 2 (bor 2 (mul 4)) }}

# While in this statement (no binary operator), | is interpreted as go template piping operator
{{ sum 2 (2 | mul 4) }}
```
###### gotemplate syntax
```

{{ add 2 (bor 2 (mul 4)) }}


{{ sum 2 (2 | mul 4) }}
```

###### Result
```

8


10
```
